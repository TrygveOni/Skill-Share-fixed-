Thanks for downloading !

This is the fixed version of Zorora's Skill Share mod for A21.

Zorora wanted a way to to share skills points in multiplay so she added teaching books to all the crafting skill trees. 
Every 5 levels you gain in a crafting skill, you learn to craft a teaching book that brings the player that uses it up to the same skill level. Teaching books require coal, leather, paper, and grass fibers to craft.

Search for the books in your inventory to craft them, they won't show up in any category.

Just drop the extracted file in your MODS directory inside your 7 Days to Die directory. You should see Config, ModInfo.xml and README.md when opening the skillShare folder.
